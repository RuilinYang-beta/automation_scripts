# About

## Basic functionality

The script would search Nintendo Switch games available to lend at Hamburg Library ([BÃ¼chehallen Hamburg](https://www.buecherhallen.de/)).

## Future functionality

After knowing what games are available at which libraries, it further queries the travel time from my location to each library.
